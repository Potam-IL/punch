## Desired Interface
name-glob below means a name optionally including '*' for any chars and
'?' for a single char. '\' is an escape character.

    punch tasks list
    punch tasks add/new name and the rest is comments
    punch tasks remove/del/rm -f/--force name-glob name-glob name-glob

`--force` prevents asking for confirmation prior to deletion.

    punch in name-glob
list tasks matching, or if just 1, declare it; no task lists all to choose from

    punch out comment

    punch times (dumps path as comment followed by contents)

Invoke as `punch times file` or `punch times -` to dump from that source
and validate its format.

## DRY Up Code
Unify file access around the notion of de/serializing Tasks.

    Task.parse(), Task.format()

The parser knows to skip blank lines and comment lines:
    parser = FileParser(path)
    parser.readTasks()
    parser.writeTasks(tasks, fileobj)

Write out entire task in all files. No need for a comprehensive task database.
This should be a SIMPLE tool, not your average billing department mess.

A task is just:

    one-word-name start-time/duration free-form comment till end of line

    tps-report 2012-02-25T17:35:45Z/PT12H05M36S man this sucks

Last 3 are optional. If you want a default comment, just do

    name / whatever your comment is

in tasks.

## New Arch
* Task -- name, start, duration, comment

    ^(\S+)\s*([^/]+)/(\S+)\s*(.+)$

* TaskStream -- skips comment and blank lines
    - read(fileobj)
    - write(taskseq)

* ISO -- handles ISO formatting, UTC->local conversions for summary
    - now() -- current date-time in UTC
    - duration(start=, stop=, duration=) supply any two, it returns the third
    - local(datetime) -- converts to local time

* Path -- global again -- config but named better
* Switch back to procedural code for the commands:
    - punch_in(glob), punch_out(), punch_now(), punch_times free functions
    - parse ourselves rather than messing with argparse(), since we don't have
      any switches
